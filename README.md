# 🚀 React Snippets Playground

Hi! I'm **Inshrah Maryam** 👋  
This is a small React playground where I practiced key frontend concepts using small, focused code snippets.


### 🧪 What I Practiced

- 🛑 **Error Handling** using 404 routes and conditional rendering.
- ⏳ **Suspense & Lazy Loading** with `React.lazy()` and `<Suspense>` fallback UIs.
- ⚡ **Concurrent Rendering** using `createRoot()` from React 18 and `StrictMode`.
- 📦 **Code Splitting** by lazy-loading components only when needed.
- 🧱 **Error Boundaries** to catch runtime errors without crashing the whole app.
- 🧭 **React Router** for page navigation and route-based component rendering.
